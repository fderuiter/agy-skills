# Fowler Code Smells Baseline

A baseline catalog of Fowler code smells (*Refactoring*, ch.3) used when reviewing code changes against coding standards.

## Smell Principles

- **The repo overrides**: A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call**: Each smell is a labelled heuristic (e.g. "possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Skip anything tooling already enforces.

## Smell Catalog

- **Mysterious Name**: A function, variable, or type whose name does not reveal what it does or holds. -> Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design is murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: The same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. -> Extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: A method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. -> Move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: The same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). -> Bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: A primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. -> Give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: The same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. -> Replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: One logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. -> Gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: One file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. -> Split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: Abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec does not have. -> Delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: Long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller should not depend on. -> Hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: A class or function that mostly just delegates onward. -> Cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: A subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. -> Drop the inheritance, use composition.
