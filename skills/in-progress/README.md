# In Progress

Beta. These skills are public on purpose: try them and tell me what breaks. They're excluded from the plugin and the top-level README until they graduate to a stable bucket, they get no docs pages, and they can change or disappear without warning.

The plugin won't give you these. Install one directly:

```bash
npx skills@latest add fderuiter/agy-skills --skill=<name>
```

- **[loop-me](./loop-me/SKILL.md)**: Grill yourself into implementable workflow specs over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful workspace. User-invoked.
- **[handoff-context](./handoff-context/SKILL.md)**: Hand the current conversation off to a fresh background agent that picks up the work immediately, seeded with a handoff summary. User-invoked.
- **[setup-ts-deep-modules](./setup-ts-deep-modules/SKILL.md)**: Wire dependency-cruiser into a TypeScript repo so each package is a deep module: implementation hidden in subfolders, reachable only through its entry-point files, tests exercising it through those. User-invoked.
